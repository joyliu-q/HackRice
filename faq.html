                        <h5>While there is no one-size-fits-all formula, factors we look for include the number of people affected, the presence of inequality or discrimination, the importance of spreading awareness, as well as other factors. Ultimately, if it’s something that hurts people and needs to be improved, we will likely consider it a relevant social issue. </h5>

                        <h5>Involvopedia is a platform that educates its users about important social issues. The interested and not interested buttons below every social issue allow us to identify the types of social issues you’re interested in, so that we can improve your experience by not showing you issues that you do not want to learn further about. </h5>

                        <h5>Most people are unaware of a lot of social issues, and that’s perfectly OK! The best way to become a more active member of your community is to learn about the issues facing your peers, and a great way to do that is Involvopedia, which will allow you to learn about issues facing your hometown, your country, or the entire world. You can also learn about issues that don’t directly affect you or your local community, but still affect a lot of people around the world. </h5>
