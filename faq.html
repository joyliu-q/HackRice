        <h2>FAQ:</h2>
        <h3>How do you recommend users about social issues?<br>
            We will add a feature to allow members to create an account and select areas and topics they may be interested in, and use these data to recommend our users social issues.<br>
            How do you add new cards?<br>
            We will add a feature to allow organizations to register and create new cards.<br>
            How will you make sure all the cards are introducing social issues, rather than fake news or propaganda?<br>
            We will have a committee to approve every single new card submissions from organizations. We will also check the organizationâ€™s previous records to ensure they are using our website appropriately.<br>
