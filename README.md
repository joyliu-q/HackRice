# HackRice X | Involvepedia

Involvepedia is an activism-based Quizlet/Tinder hybrid, with the mission of educating people on social justice issues with tailored user interest. In the site, users can browse through a variety of social justice movements, and with a “swipe right” on a card, a longer description will pop up, giving further information on the topics as well as informing ways that users can help/stay involved.
